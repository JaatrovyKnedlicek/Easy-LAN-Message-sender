# Easy LAN Message and File sender
This is my little project. It's a program that lets you send messages and files between computers in a LAN Network using the TCP protocol for Windows 10 or newer.
## WIP
I'm still working on the project. This is a pre-release alpha version with only basic in-dev functions.
## Installation
**Runtime installation** you need to install [.NET Desktop Runtime 9.0](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/685792b6-4827-4dca-a971-bce5d7905170/1bf61b02151bc56e763dc711e45f0e1e/windowsdesktop-runtime-9.0.0-win-x64.exe) to be able to run the program.
**Downloading the program** then download the program from releases. You can just extract the content of the win-x64.zip and you're ready to go.
## Use
**Running the program** You can run the program by opening `LAN File Sender.exe` from the zip file you downloaded. For communication between computers, programs must be run on both computers. I recommend using port 5000.
### Functions explained:

 - **Setup exceptions** this setup firewall exceptions so Windows built-in firewall will not block traffic from the program.
 - **Send/Receive message** sends a basic message from one computer to another computer.
 - **Send/Receive file** sends a file from one to another computer.
 
## Requirements
 - **Windows 10 x64 or newer**
 - **.NET Runtime 9.0 or .NET Runtime Desktop 9.0** I reccomend to download **Runtime Desktop**.
